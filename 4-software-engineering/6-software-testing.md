# Chapter 6 - Software Testing

Software testing is a necessary and important activity of the software development process. It is an expensive process and consumes one-third to one-half of the cost of the typical development project. Therefore, a proper strategy is required to carry out testing activities systematically and effectively.

Software Testing provides a framework or set of activities, which are essential for the success of the project. This may include planning,designing of test cases, execution of a program with test cases, interpretation of the outcome and finally collection and management of data. Effective software testing will contribute to:
1. Delivery of high quality of software products.
2. More satisfied users.
3. Lower maintenance cost.
4. More accurate and reliable results.

The testing can be broadly divided into two forms:
1. **Verification Testing**: This is used for requirement verification, design verification, code verification during various phases.
2. **Validation Testing**: Validation testing is the process of evaluating a system at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements.

## Software Testing Strategies
Software testing strategies integrates software test case design techniques into a well planned series of steps that result in the successful construction of software. Any test strategy incoporate test planning, test case design, test execution, and the resultant data collection and evaluation. General characterstics of these strategies are:

1. **Testing begins at the module level and work outwards**

    Test which are carried out, are done at the module level where major functionality is tested and it works towards the intgration of the entire system.

2. **Different testing techniques are appropriate at different points in time**

   Different testing techniques are to be used under different circumstances. circumstances mean the levels at which testing is being done.

3. **The developer of the software conducts testing and if the project is big then there is a testing team**

4. **Debugging and testing are all together different processes**

   As testing aims to find errors whereas debugging is the process of fixing those errors.

In order to conduct a proper testing, the following order should be performed as shown:

As shown above first unit testing is performed. Unit testing focuses on the individual module of the product. After this we perform integration testing. When modules are integrated into bigger problems then we see new errors often. After integration acceptance testing is performed which is comprise of system testing and validation testing.
