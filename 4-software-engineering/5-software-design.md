# Chapter 5 - Software Designing
Software design is a mechanism to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation. It deals with representing the client's requirement, as described in SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document, into a form, i.e., easily implementable using a programming language.

The software design phase is the first step in SDLC (Software Design Life Cycle), which moves the concentration from the problem domain to the solution domain. In software design, we consider the system to be a set of components or modules with clearly defined behaviors & boundaries.

## Objective of Software Designing

1. **Correctness** : Software design should be correct as per requirement.
2. ****Completeness** : The design should have all components like data structures, modules, and external interfaces, etc.
3. **Efficiency** : Resources should be used efficiently by the program.
4. **Flexibility** : Able to modify on changing needs.
5. **Consistency** : There should not be any inconsistency in the design.
6. **Maintainability** : The design should be so simple so that it can be easily maintainable by other designers.
