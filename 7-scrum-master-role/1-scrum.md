# Scrum

## Introduction

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a complex problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve and have an effective team collaboration.

While the Scrum I’m talking about is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. This is one of the reasons Scrum is so popular. Often thought of as an agile project management framework, Scrum describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.

This article will cover, the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.

### Scrum is:

> Lightweight

> Simple to understand

> Difficult to master

## Scrum Framework

People often think Scrum and agile are the same thing because Scrum is centered around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of agile. However, Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset. You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like Scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.

While Scrum is structured, it is not entirely rigid. Its execution can be tailored to the needs of any organization. There are many theories about how exactly scrum teams must work in order to be successful. We’ve learned that clear communication, transparency, and a dedication for continuous improvement should always remain at the center of whatever framework you choose.

## Scrum Principles - 3 Pillars of Empirical Process Control

### Transparency

To make decisions, people need visibility into the process and the current state of the product. To ensure everyone understands what they are seeing, participants in an empirical process must share one language

### Inspection

To prevent deviation from the desired process or end product, people need to inspect what is being created, and how, at regular intervals. Inspection should occur at the point of work but should not get in the way of that work.

### Adaptation

When deviations occur, the process or product should be adjusted as soon as possible.

## Scrum Values

### The Five Scrum Values

#### Commitment

The Scrum value of commitment is essential for building an agile culture. Scrum teams work together as a unit. This means that Scrum and agile teams trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do. When team members aren’t sure how work is going, they ask. Agile teams only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, so they are careful not to overcommit.

#### Courage

The Scrum value of courage is critical to an agile team’s success. Scrum teams must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things. Agile teams must be brave enough to question the status quo when it hampers their ability to succeed.

#### Focus

The Scrum value of focus is one of the best skills Scrum teams can develop. Focus means that whatever Scrum teams start they finish--so agile teams are relentless about limiting the amount of work in process (limit WIP).

#### Openness

Scrum teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn. Agile teams are also honest when they need help.

#### Respect

Scrum team members demonstrate respect to one another, to the product owner, to stakeholders, and to the ScrumMaster. Agile teams know that their strength lies in how well they collaborate, and that everyone has a distinct contribution to make toward completing the work of the sprint. They respect each other’s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recognize each other’s accomplishments.
