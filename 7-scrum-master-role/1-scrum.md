# Chapter 1 - Scrum

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.\
Scrum, a popular agile methodology originally used for software development, is now being successfully implemented in other business domains. In a unique twist, agile is now being applied to personal project management. Though some agile techniques may not apply, the concepts of iterative processes, continuous improvement, empowerment, and collaboration can be applied to many areas of personal life.\
Scrum is now also used for Event Planning, one of the most creative I've seen is Scrum Your Wedding, a wedding planning business that educates customers on how to plan a wedding using scrum.

## Scrum Framework

People often think Scrum and agile are the same thing because Scrum is centered around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of agile. However, Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset. You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like Scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.

### Scrum Principles

<p align="center"> <img width="350" height="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*aG4Rf5IhJjZNant5dhD3Uw.png"></p>

1. **Transparency**: To make decisions, people need visibility into the process and the current state of the product. To ensure everyone understands what they are seeing, participants in an empirical process must share one language.
2. **Inspection**: To prevent deviation from the desired process or end product, people need to inspect what is being created, and how, at regular intervals. Inspection should occur at the point of work but should not get in the way of that work.
3. **Adaptation**: When deviations occur, the process or product should be adjusted as soon as possible.

### Scrum Values

1. **Courage**: The Scrum value of courage is critical to an agile team’s success. Scrum teams must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things. Agile teams must be brave enough to question the status quo when it hampers their ability to succeed.
2. **Focus**: The Scrum value of focus is one of the best skills Scrum teams can develop. Focus means that whatever Scrum teams start they finish--so agile teams are relentless about limiting the amount of work in process (limit WIP).
3. **Commitment**: The Scrum value of commitment is essential for building an agile culture. Scrum teams work together as a unit. This means that Scrum and agile teams trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do. When team members aren’t sure how work is going, they ask. Agile teams only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, so they are careful not to overcommit.

4. **Respect**: Scrum team members demonstrate respect to one another, to the PO, to stakeholders, and to the ScrumMaster. Agile teams know that their strength lies in how well they collaborate, and that everyone has a distinct contribution to make toward completing the work of the sprint. They respect each other’s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recognize each other’s accomplishments.
5. **Openness**: Scrum teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn. Agile teams are also honest when they need help.

## Scrum Team

A Scrum Team is a collection of individuals (typically between five and nine members) working together to deliver the required product increments. The Scrum framework encourages a high level of communication among team members, so that the team can: Follow a common goal, adhere the same norms and rules, show respect to each other

Scrum defines three roles: ScrumMaster, PO, and Development Team. Together all three roles make up a Scrum Team.

1. **Product Owner**: The PO defines the what--as in what the product will look like and what features it should contain. The PO is expected to incorporate stakeholder feedback to create the highest value product increments each and every sprint. POs maintain the product backlog and ensures that everyone knows the priorities.
2. **Development Team**: The Development Team decides how to accomplish the work set forth by the PO. Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes overall efficiency and effectiveness.
3. **Scrum Master**: The ScrumMaster helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. ScrumMasters hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum artifacts are ways to describe the work that must be done, and they always add value during a sprint. Scrum artifacts can be seen as nuggets of vital information for the scrum team. They capture shared information for the team at a particular point in time.

This is vitally important, especially for distributed teams who may work from home because it provides a platform where they can see how they’re doing on a particular sprint. This keeps everyone on the same page, no matter where they are.

Scrum defines three artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and a product increment

1. **Product Backlog**: The PB is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product. It is constantly evolving and is never complete.

2. **Sprint Backlog**: The Sprint Backlog is a list of everything that the team commits to achieve in a given Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team.

   If the Development Team needs to drop an item from the Sprint Backlog, they must negotiate it with the PO. During this negotiation, the ScrumMaster should work with the Development Team and PO to try to find ways to create some smaller increment of an item rather than drop it altogether.

3. **Product Increment**: At the end of every Sprint, the team must complete a product increment that is potentially releasable, meaning that meets their agreed-upon definition of done. (An example might be fully tested and fully approved.)

## Scrum Events

### Sprint

Scrum Teams work in short timeframes called sprints. Sprints can be as short as one week or as long as one month. Sprints happen one right after the other, with no breaks, to maintain a steady project cadence.

Each sprint begins with a plan and ends with a review of the work completed and an additional review of the way in which the team worked together.

During each sprint, the entire Scrum Team works together to complete one or more increments of a larger overall product or project. Each completed increment must be potentially releasable, meaning that it could theoretically be delivered as is. In other words, each increment must be fully tested and fully approved by the end of the sprint.

Scrum defines four events (sometimes called ceremonies) that occur inside each Sprint:

### 1. Sprint Planning

<p align="center"> <img width="450" height="" src="https://www.techagilist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sprint-Planning.png"></p>

Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.

Sprint Planning Meeting is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The SM ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The SM teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box.

During Sprint Planning, the entire Scrum Team collaborates and discusses the desired high-priority work for the Sprint and defines the Sprint Goal. The ScrumMaster’s role is primarily to facilitate the meeting. The PO describes the objective of the Sprint and also answers questions from the Development Team about execution and acceptance criteria / criteria of satisfaction. The development team has the final say in how much of the high-priority work it can accomplish during the Sprint.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

- _What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?_
- _How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?_

Work is selected from the PB and pulled into the Sprint Backlog. Now remember that the work in the Sprint Backlog is not a commitment, it is a forecast. The only container of a Sprint is its time box, not the work planned for the Sprint.

**Sprint Goal**\
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of PB. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. As the Development Team works, it does so with the Sprint Goal always in mind.

### 2. Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours. This optimizes team collaboration and performance by inspecting the work since the last Daily Scrum and forecasting upcoming Sprint work. The Daily Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity.\
This is not a status meeting but is instead an opportunity for the Development Team to inspect and adapt the product and process on a daily basis.

The SM ensures that the Development Team has the meeting, but the Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum. The SM teaches the Development Team to keep the Daily Scrum within the 15-minute time-box. The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Team. If others are present, the SM ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.

### 3. Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the PB if needed. There could have been a single deployment or many deployments during a Sprint which lead up to that Increment to be inspected.

Sprint reviews focus on the product being development, specifically on the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint. During a sprint review, the Scrum Team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the Sprint. They adapt the PB as needed based on this feedback. The PO has the option to release any of the completed functionality.

Though a demo might be part of this meeting, the primary purpose of the Sprint Review is the inspect and adapt capability provided by the discussion.

The entire Scrum Team attends the sprint review. Any stakeholders, senior managers, and other affected departments (e.g., marketing, customer support) are invited to attend and give feedback. Scrum teams should invite as many people as the room can hold--diverse feedback is essential for creating excellent products.

This is at most a four-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The SM ensures that the event takes place and that attendees understand its purpose. The SM teaches everyone involved to keep it within the time-box.

### 4. Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. They make tangible plans for how to improve their own process, tools and relationships.

The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning. This is at most a three-hour meeting for one-month Sprints. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The SM ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. This is the opportunity for the Scrum Team to improve and all members should be in attendance.

During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

- What went well in the Sprint
- What could be improved
- What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint

By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.

As per Scrum, there are only four major events, but in real life there are 5 events. The fifth meeting is:

### The Backlog Refinement Meeting

The Backlog Refinement meeting (or backlog management meeting, or backlog grooming session) usually takes place towards the end of the current sprint.The purpose of the backlog refinement meeting is to decompose the highest priority items in the product backlog into user stories which are suitable for inclusion in the next sprint.

Attendance varies but certainly includes the Product Owner and the meeting is often facilitated by the ScrumMaster. What’s important is that representation of what is feasible, valuable and a good user experience are present. It is time-boxed, usually to no more than 2 hours for a two week sprint.

The benefits of having a separate backlog management meeting are threefold: it reduces the need for a long sprint planning meeting which can be hard to schedule and which can tax even the longest of attention spans. It also gives the team a chance to reflect on the backlog items discussed in the meeting before committing to the sprint backlog and sprint goal. And it offers greater flexibility to look a little further ahead.

## Summary

There you have it. This was everything you need to know about Scrum to make your project a success. But you must keep one thing in mind and that is Scrum is not a silver bullet or a magic cure. Scrum can, however, enable you to embrace the change that accompany all complex product development efforts.

Although the Scrum framework is relatively simple, it would be a mistake to assume that Scrum is easy and painless to apply. One way to make it easier to adopt and agile process like Scrum is to get the proper training and coaching along the way.
