# Scrum

## Introduction

_An [agile] framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value._

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a complex problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve and have an effective team collaboration.\
Though it has its roots in software development, today Scrum refers to a lightweight framework that is used in every industry to deliver complex, innovative products and services that truly delight customers. It is simple to understand, but difficult to master.\
This article will cover, the definition of Scrum. This definition consists of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together.

_Lightweight, Simple to understand, Difficult to master_

## Scrum Framework

People often think Scrum and agile are the same thing because Scrum is centered around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of agile. However, Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset. You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like Scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.

## Scrum Principles - 3 Pillars of Empirical Process Control

**Transparency**\
To make decisions, people need visibility into the process and the current state of the product. To ensure everyone understands what they are seeing, participants in an empirical process must share one language\
**Inspection**\
To prevent deviation from the desired process or end product, people need to inspect what is being created, and how, at regular intervals. Inspection should occur at the point of work but should not get in the way of that work.\
**Adaptation**\
When deviations occur, the process or product should be adjusted as soon as possible.

## Scrum Values

**Commitment**\
The Scrum value of commitment is essential for building an agile culture. Scrum teams work together as a unit. This means that Scrum and agile teams trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do. When team members aren’t sure how work is going, they ask. Agile teams only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, so they are careful not to overcommit.\
**Courage**\
The Scrum value of courage is critical to an agile team’s success. Scrum teams must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things. Agile teams must be brave enough to question the status quo when it hampers their ability to succeed.\
**Focus**\
The Scrum value of focus is one of the best skills Scrum teams can develop. Focus means that whatever Scrum teams start they finish--so agile teams are relentless about limiting the amount of work in process (limit WIP).\
**Openness**\
Scrum teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn. Agile teams are also honest when they need help.\
**Respect**\
Scrum team members demonstrate respect to one another, to the product owner, to stakeholders, and to the ScrumMaster. Agile teams know that their strength lies in how well they collaborate, and that everyone has a distinct contribution to make toward completing the work of the sprint. They respect each other’s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recognize each other’s accomplishments.

## The Roles of the Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum defines three artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and a potentially releasable product increment

**Product Backlog**\
The Product Backlog is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product. It is constantly evolving and is never complete.

**Sprint Backlog**\
The Sprint Backlog is a list of everything that the team commits to achieve in a given Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team.

If the Development Team needs to drop an item from the Sprint Backlog, they must negotiate it with the Product Owner. During this negotiation, the ScrumMaster should work with the Development Team and Product Owner to try to find ways to create some smaller increment of an item rather than drop it altogether.

**Potentially Releasable Product Increment**\
At the end of every Sprint, the team must complete a product increment that is potentially releasable, meaning that meets their agreed-upon definition of done. (An example might be fully tested and fully approved.)

## Tracking Progress with Sprint Burndown Charts

A sprint burndown (or burnup) chart is not an official Scrum artifact but many teams use it to communicate and track progress toward the sprint goal during the sprint.

**What Is the Purpose of the Sprint Burndown Chart?**\
Sprint burndown charts helps teams gauge whether they will complete the work of a sprint. Burndown charts also reinforce the Scrum values of commitment, focus and openness and one of the three pillars of empirical process control: transparency.

**What Is a Sprint Burndown Chart?**\
Sprint burndowns are a graphical way of showing how much work is remaining in the sprint, typically in terms of task hours. It is typically updated at the daily scrum. As the sprint progresses, the amount of work remaining should steadily decrease and should trend toward being complete on the last day of the sprint. Burndowns that show increasing work or few completed tasks are signals to the ScrumMaster and the team that the sprint is not going well.

## Scrum Events

Scrum defines four events (sometimes called ceremonies) that occur inside each Sprint:

- Sprint
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

**What is a Sprint in Scrum?**\
Scrum Teams work in short timeframes called sprints. Sprints can be as short as one week or as long as one month. Sprints happen one right after the other, with no breaks, to maintain a steady project cadence.

Each sprint begins with a plan and ends with a review of the work completed and an additional review of the way in which the team worked together.

During each sprint, the entire Scrum Team works together to complete one or more increments of a larger overall product or project. Each completed increment must be potentially releasable, meaning that it could theoretically be delivered as is. In other words, each increment must be fully tested and fully approved by the end of the sprint.

**What is Sprint Planning?**\
Sprint planning is an event in scrum that kicks off the sprint. The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.

**What Happens in Sprint Planning?**\
During Sprint Planning, the entire Scrum Team collaborates and discusses the desired high-priority work for the Sprint and defines the Sprint Goal. The ScrumMaster’s role is primarily to facilitate the meeting. The Product Owner describes the objective of the Sprint and also answers questions from the Development Team about execution and acceptance criteria / criteria of satisfaction. The development team has the final say in how much of the high-priority work it can accomplish during the Sprint.

**Who attends Sprint Planning?**\
Sprint planning involves the entire Scrum Team: the development team, product owner, and ScrumMaster.

**How long should Sprint Planning Last?**\
Sprint planning is limited to a maximum of eight hours.

The general rule of thumb is to allow two hours of sprint planning for every one week of sprint length. That means teams should timebox sprint planning to four hours for a two-week sprint and eight hours for a one-month sprint.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

- _What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?_
- _How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?_

Work is selected from the Product Backlog and pulled into the Sprint Backlog. Now remember that the work in the Sprint Backlog is not a commitment, it is a forecast. The only container of a Sprint is its time box, not the work planned for the Sprint.

**Sprint Goal**\
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. As the Development Team works, it does so with the Sprint Goal always in mind.

### Daily Scrum

**What Happens in a Daily Scrum?**\
The Development Team meets for 15 minutes (or less) every day of the Sprint to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal. They describe for each other how their own work is going, ask for help when needed, and consider whether they are still on track to meet the Sprint Goal. This is not a status meeting but is instead an opportunity for the Development Team to inspect and adapt the product and process on a daily basis.

**Who Attends the Daily Scrum?**\
The mandatory participants at the Daily Scrum are the development team and the ScrumMaster. The product owner is invited but doesn’t have to attend.

### Sprint Review

**What Happens in a Sprint Review?**\
Sprint reviews focus on the product being development, specifically on the potentially shippable product increment created during the sprint. During a sprint review, the Scrum Team invites stakeholders to discuss what was completed during the Sprint. They adapt the Product Backlog as needed based on this feedback. The Product Owner has the option to release any of the completed functionality.

Though a demo might be part of this meeting, the primary purpose of the Sprint Review is the inspect and adapt capability provided by the discussion.

**Who Attends a Sprint Review?**\
The entire Scrum Team attends the sprint review. Any stakeholders, senior managers, and other affected departments (e.g., marketing, customer support) are invited to attend and give feedback. Scrum teams should invite as many people as the room can hold--diverse feedback is essential for creating excellent products.

**How Long Should Sprint Reviews Last?**\
The general rule of thumb is to allow one hour for sprint review per every one week of sprint length. That means teams should timebox sprint review to two hours for a two-week sprint and four hours for a one-month sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective

**What Happens in a Sprint Retrospective?**\
Sprint retrospectives focus on the process. During a sprint retrospective the Scrum Team discusses what went right and areas for improvement in the Sprint. They make tangible plans for how to improve their own process, tools and relationships.

**What Is the Difference between Sprint Reviews & Sprint Retrospectives?**\
Sprint reviews focus on the product. Sprint Retrospectives focus on the process.

**Who Should Attend a Sprint Retrospective?**\
Sprint retrospectives are for the Scrum Team, which would include the development team, ScrumMaster, and product owner. In practice, product owners are recommended but not mandatory attendees.

**How Long Should Sprint Retrospectives Last?**\
The general guidance is to allow 45 minutes for each week of sprint length. So a two-week sprint would cap the sprint retrospective at an hour and a half; a four-week sprint at three hours.

**Summary**\
_Now that you know a bit more about what Scrum is and how it works, you might be wondering how to get started with Scrum. We recommend some combination of Scrum training and agile coaching from a Certified Scrum Trainer® (CST®) or Scrum Alliance Certified Agile CoachSM (CEC or CTC) to transform your workplace._

_Transitioning to an agile framework such as Scrum requires a new mindset and overall cultural adjustments. And like all change, it doesn't come easy. But when teams and organizations fully commit to Scrum, they'll discover a new sense of flexibility, creativity, and inspiration - all of which will lead to greater results._
