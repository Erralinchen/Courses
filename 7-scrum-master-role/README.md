# Agile Overview

_“Agile is a philosophy that encourages organizational models where people collaborate towards a common goal”_

## Agile methodology definition:

Agile methodology is a type of project management process, mainly used for software development, where demands and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customers.

The Agile Manifesto was created as a response to the inadequacies of traditional development methods. The software industry is a highly competitive market due to the fact that software is continuously upgraded.

## What is the Agile Manifesto?

The Agile Manifesto is a declaration of the values and principles expressed in agile methodology. Made up for four foundational values and 12 key principles, it aims to help uncover better ways of developing software by providing a clear and measurable structure that promotes iterative development, team collaboration, and change recognition.

The values and principles of the ‘Manifesto for Agile Software Development’ are:

### Values

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

### Principles

1.  Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.  Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
3.  Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
4.  Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
5.  Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
6.  Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
7.  Working software is the primary measure of progress
8.  Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
9.  Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential
11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
